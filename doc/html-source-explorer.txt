						*html-source-explorer-intro*
1. Overview~

The "HTML Source Explorer" plugin is meant to aid on the html source exploring.
It allows you to follow links by opening them on a new buffer on vim (the same
way you can follow links on Mozilla Firefox/Chrome view source).

By using <leader>fl inside "", '' or (), if it is a link (absolute, or
relative) the file will be open.

It works both on http:// urls and local files.

==============================================================================
						*html-source-explorer-requirements*
3. Requirements~

The html-source-explorer plugin requires the following:

    * Vim version 6.0 and above
    * wget (for http support)

==============================================================================
						*html-source-explorer-install*
4. Installation~

1. Download the html-source-explorer.zip file and unzip the files to the $HOME/.vim or the
   $HOME/vimfiles or the $VIM/vimfiles directory. After this step, you should
   have the following two files (the directory structure should be preserved):

	plugin/html-source-explorer.vim - main html-source-explorer plugin file
	doc/html-source-explorer.txt    - documentation (help) file

   Refer to the |add-plugin| and |'runtimepath'| Vim help pages for more
   details about installing Vim plugins.
2. Change to the $HOME/.vim/doc or $HOME/vimfiles/doc or $VIM/vimfiles/doc
   directory, start Vim and run the ":helptags ." command to process the
   html-source-explorer help file. Without this step, you cannot jump to the html-source-explorer help
   topics.
3. You can use Pathogen to install this plugin

To uninstall the html-source-explorer plugin, remove the plugin/html-source-explorer.vim and
doc/html-source-explorer.txt files from the $HOME/.vim or $HOME/vimfiles directory.

==============================================================================
						*html-source-explorer-using*
5. Usage~

The html-source-explorer plugin can be used in several different ways.

1. You can keep the html-source-explorer window open during the entire editing session. On
   opening the html-source-explorer window, the tags defined in all the files in the Vim
   buffer list will be displayed in the html-source-explorer window. As you edit files, the
   tags defined in them will be added to the html-source-explorer window. You can select a
   tag from the html-source-explorer window and jump to it. The current tag will be
   highlighted in the html-source-explorer window. You can close the html-source-explorer window when
   you no longer need the window.

==============================================================================
						*html-source-explorer-commands*
7. Commands~

The html-source-explorer plugin provides the following ex-mode commands:

|:TlistAddFiles|	Add multiple files to the html-source-explorer.
						*:TlistAddFiles*
:TlistAddFiles {file(s)} [file(s) ...]
		Add one or more specified files to the html-source-explorer. You can
		specify multiple filenames using wildcards. To specify a
		file name with space character, you should escape the space
		character with a backslash.
		Examples:
>
		    :TlistAddFiles *.c *.cpp
		    :TlistAddFiles file1.html file2.html
<
		If you specify a large number of files, then it will take some
		time for the html-source-explorer plugin to process all of them. The
		specified files will not be edited in a Vim window and will
		not be added to the Vim buffer list.


==============================================================================
						*html-source-explorer-functions*
8. Global functions~

The html-source-explorer plugin provides several global functions that can be used from
other Vim plugins to interact with the html-source-explorer plugin. These functions are
described below.

|Tlist_Update_File_Tags()|		Update the tags for the specified file

					    *Tlist_Update_File_Tags()*
Tlist_Update_File_Tags({filename}, {filetype})
		Update the tags for the file {filename}. The second argument
		specifies the Vim filetype for the file. If the html-source-explorer plugin
		has not processed the file previously, then the exuberant
		ctags tool is invoked to generate the tags for the file.


==============================================================================
